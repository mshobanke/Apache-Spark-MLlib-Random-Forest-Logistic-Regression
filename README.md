# Apache-Spark-MLlib-Random-Forest-Logistic-Regression
In this task, we evaluate the performance of two machine learning models from the Spark MLlib library in predicting the risk of coronary heart disease over a ten-year period. Despite obtaining low accuracy from both models, we investigate whether there may be confounding variables present in the dataset that could be causing bias in the estimation of the relationship between explanatory and dependent variables.
