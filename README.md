# Apache-Spark-MLlib-Random-Forest-Logistic-Regression
In this task, the performance of two machine learning models from the Spark MLlib library in predicting the risk of coronary heart disease over a ten-year period is evaluated. Due to the low accuracy from both models, we investigate the possibility of bias in the dataset.
